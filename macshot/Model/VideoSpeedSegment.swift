/// Unlike zoom / censor (pixel transforms) or cuts (frames removed), a speed
/// segment is a *time scaling*: the composition-clock duration of the range
/// is `(srcEnd - srcStart) / speedFactor`. `speedFactor > 1` makes the range
/// play faster; `speedFactor < 1` slower. A factor of exactly 1 is a no-op
/// and is not allowed — callers should delete the segment instead.
///
/// Semantics are deliberately kept simple to match existing segment types:
///   - Times are stored in source-asset seconds (pre-trim, pre-cut).
///   - Speed segments never overlap each other. The UI enforces this.
///   - Speed segments should not overlap cut ranges. The export pipeline
///     clips them to the kept ranges; the UI prevents new overlaps.
///   - Audio scales along with video. On macOS the standard
///     `AVMutableCompositionTrack.scaleTimeRange` re-pitches audio (no
///     pitch preservation). That matches iMovie's default behavior and
///     keeps the pipeline simple.
